COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.

We use [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf) to extract some insights on COVID death rate.

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()

```

Let's skim the data to find out the variables, unique values and missing values first:

```{r}
skim(covid_data)
```

And then, we have pre- processed the data, removing all missing, unknown and NA values so that we are left with a clean dataframe.
```{r}

#selecting required variables for our graphs
covid_data <- covid_data %>% 
  select(age_group, sex, death_yn, icu_yn, medcond_yn)

#filtering to remove unwanted values
covid_data <- drop_na(covid_data)

filtered_data <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(!icu_yn %in% c("Missing", "Unknown") & !death_yn %in% c("Missing", "Unknown") & !sex %in% c("Missing", "Unknown", "Other") & !age_group %in% c("Unknown") & !medcond_yn %in% c("Missing", "Unknown"))
```

Using this new dataframe, we calculated the death rate separately of COVID patients based on whether they had some other medical conditions and whether they were admitted in the ICU:
```{r}

#calculating death rate for icu admits
death_icu <- filtered_data %>%  
  group_by(sex, age_group, icu_yn) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate= count(death_yn=="Yes")/(count(death_yn=="Yes")+count(death_yn=="No"))) %>% 
  mutate(death_rate=death_rate*100)
death_icu %>% kbl() %>% kable_styling()

```

```{r}
#calculating death rate for presence/absence co-morbidities
death_medcond <- filtered_data %>%  
  group_by(sex, age_group, medcond_yn) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate= count(death_yn=="Yes")/(count(death_yn=="Yes")+count(death_yn=="No"))) %>% 
  mutate(death_rate=death_rate*100)
death_medcond %>% kbl() %>% kable_styling()
```

We generated some useful graphs based on the death rate results we found from the previous code

1. Graph showing death % rate by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not:
```{r, fig.width=12}

# ordering and naming labels
death_medcond$medcond_yn = factor(death_medcond$medcond_yn, levels=c('Yes','No'))

new_labels <- list("Yes"="With co-morbidities", "No"= "Without co-morbidities")

medcond_labeller <- function(variable,value){
  return(new_labels[value])
}

#plotting graph
p <- ggplot(death_medcond, aes(x=death_rate, y=age_group))+
  geom_bar(stat="Identity", fill = "blue", alpha= 0.5)+
  facet_grid(medcond_yn ~ sex, labeller = labeller(medcond_yn=medcond_labeller))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,1)), hjust = -0.2, size=2.5,position = position_dodge(width = 1))+
  labs(subtitle ="Covid % death rate by age, sex and whether the patient has co-morbidites", x="", y="", caption = "Source: CDC") +
  NULL
p
```
As expected, the rate of death among both males and females having additional medical conditions was considerably higher than those who did not. Apart from that, elder people falling in the 70+ age intervals are a lot more prone to facing major consequences like death due to COVID than younger age groups that seem to recover more often.

2. Graph showing death % rate by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not:


```{r fig.width=12}

#ordering and naming labels

death_icu$icu_yn = factor(death_icu$icu_yn, levels=c('Yes','No'))

new_labels <- list("Yes"="Admitted to ICU", "No"= "No ICU")

icu_labeller <- function(variable,value){
  return(new_labels[value])
}

#plotting graph

p <- ggplot(death_icu, aes(x=death_rate, y=age_group))+
  geom_bar(stat="Identity", fill="red", alpha= 0.5)+
  facet_grid(icu_yn ~ sex, labeller = labeller(icu_yn=icu_labeller))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,1)), hjust = -0.2, size=2.5,position = position_dodge(width = 1))+
  labs(subtitle ="Covid % death rate by age, sex and whether the patient was admitted to the ICU", x="", y="", caption = "Source: CDC") + 
  NULL
p
```
It can be observed that admission to ICU indicates more chances of death, steeply increasing among people above 70 years of age.
