# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


To study climate change, we have used data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere from [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp).

The base period to calculate changes is taken as 1951-1980.While loading the data, `skip` and `na` are used to remove the first row and missing values respectively:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```


We've converted the dataframe from wide to 'long' format and defined variables month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.

```{r tidyweather}
glimpse(weather)

## convert df from wide to long, creating a "Month" and a "Delta" variable 

tidyweather <- weather %>% select(1:13) %>% pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, names_to = "month", values_to = "delta")
tidyweather %>% kbl() %>% kable_styling()
```

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically.

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta, colour = date)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color="white") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18)) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_colour_gradient(low="blue2", high="red") +
  labs (
    title = "Temperature Anomalies Heating Up Over Past Century", 
  subtitle = "Combined land-surface air and sea-surface water temperature anomalies in the northern \nhemisphere have shifted from negative to positive in the last 100 years", x = "Year", y = "Delta", caption = "Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies") +
  theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"), axis.text=element_text(size=12),
        axis.title=element_text(size=14,face="bold"))

```

On analysing the temperature difference through different months, we find that the effects of increasing temperature appear to be homogeneous throughout different months. 

```{r facet_wrap}
## add to the title/sub , can i thin the smoothing line? , make the theme prettier (no grey months)
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta, colour = date))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="white") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_colour_gradient(low="blue2", high="red") +
  labs (
    title = "Monthly Anomalies Appear Homogeneous Over Time ", 
  subtitle = "Anomalies appear not to discriminate based on month, with monthly patterns being nearly \nindistinguishable from one another", x = "Year", y = "Delta", caption = "Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies") +
  facet_wrap(~month) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"), axis.text=element_text(size=12),
        axis.title=element_text(size=14,face="bold"))

```

Here, the years are divided into intervals to help study the data better:


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```


Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}
## fix the colors 
ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval, colour = interval))+
  
  #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   
  theme_bw() +                
  labs(
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    subtitle = "A clear increase in temperature anomalies shown through time periods \nfrom 1881 to present day",
    x = "Delta",
    y     = "Density",
    caption = "Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies")  + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue2", "darkorchid4", "purple1", "red1", "red"))  + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue2", "darkorchid4", "purple1", "red1", "red")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"), axis.text=element_text(size=12),
        axis.title=element_text(size=14,face="bold"))+
  guides(color=guide_legend("Time Period"),fill=guide_legend("Time Period"))

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_anomaly = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=year, y= annual_average_anomaly, colour = year))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(colour = "white") +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  
    ## add color gradient
  scale_colour_gradient(low="blue2", high="red") +
  
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Temperature Anomaly Signifies Steep Temperature Increase in Past 50 Years",
    subtitle = "Yearly temperature anomaly has accelerated significantly in more recent years, raising concern among climate scientists",
    y = "Average Annual Delta",
    x = "Year",
    caption = "Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies")  +
  
  theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"), axis.text=element_text(size=12),
        axis.title=element_text(size=14,face="bold"))
## make more clear 

```
