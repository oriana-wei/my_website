We got detailed data from fivethirtyeight.com [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings) to analyse Trump's approval margins.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
 approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 
```

Let's have a look on the dataset first:
```{r}
glimpse(approval_polllist)
```

The dates in the dataset are in characters category so we have to fix them to dates:
```{r}
# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist$new_modeldate <- as.Date(approval_polllist$modeldate,
                         format = "%m/%d/%Y")
approval_polllist$new_startdate <- as.Date(approval_polllist$startdate,
                         format = "%m/%d/%Y")
approval_polllist$new_enddate <- as.Date(approval_polllist$enddate,
                         format = "%m/%d/%Y")
approval_polllist$new_createddate <- as.Date(approval_polllist$createddate,
                         format = "%m/%d/%Y")
approval_polllist$new_timestamp <- as.POSIXct(approval_polllist$timestamp,
                          format = "%H:%M:%S %d %b %Y")
approval_polllist
```

we calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. 
```{r}
#add week number of each enddate
week_list <- approval_polllist %>%
mutate(week = lubridate::week(ymd(approval_polllist$new_enddate)))
week_list

#add a column for year+week
approval_year <- week_list %>% 
  mutate(year=year(new_enddate),
         year_week=year(new_enddate)* 100 + week)
approval_year

#calculate the average net approval rate and CI of each week 
week_mean <- approval_year %>% 
  group_by(year_week) %>% 
  mutate(approval_mean=mean(approve-disapprove), 
         sd_approval=sd(approve-disapprove),
         count=n(),
         t_critical=qt(0.975, count-1),
         se_approval=sd(approve-disapprove)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error=t_critical*se_approval,
            approval_low=approval_mean-margin_of_error,
            approval_high=approval_mean+margin_of_error)
week_mean

#finalize the data set showing on the plot
final_plot <- week_mean %>%
  select(year,
         week,
         approval_mean,
         approval_high,
         approval_low )
final_plot
```

Then we plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll and we use the date the poll ended.
```{r,fig.width= 22, fig.height= 12}
#plotting
library(reshape2)
#show_plot <- melt(final_plot,id.vars = "week")

ggplot(final_plot, aes(x = week, y = approval_mean, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  geom_line()+ 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = approval_low, ymax = approval_high), alpha = 0.08)+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  labs(title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump", 
       subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls", 
       x = "Week of the year", 
       y = "Average Net Approval(%)") +
#change xy ratio and extend x
    coord_fixed(ratio=1/2) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-20, 7.5, 2.5)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 52, 13)) +
    theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), colour = "orange") +
  #scale_x_continous(breaks=seq(-20,7.5,2.5)) +
  #scale_color_manual( values = c("blue","yellow","red","green"))+
  NULL
```

From the graphm compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020), the difference shows people's response on his Covid policy/reaction.
