We got the latest TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day to analyse the rentals:
```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

When we look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years, we can clearly see the decrease in bike rentals for 2020. It is quite obvious that this is the effect of the COVID-19 situation and the subsequent lockdown which prevented people from going outdoors. 

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height= 4}

# Calculate variables that feed into the graph
actual_monthly_rentals <- bike %>% 
  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  filter(year>= 2015) %>% 
  summarise(actual_per_month = mean(bikes_hired)) 
actual_monthly_rentals %>% kbl() %>% kable_styling()

expected_monthly_rentals <- bike %>%
  group_by(month) %>% 
  filter(year>= 2015) %>% 
  summarise(expected_per_month = mean(bikes_hired))
expected_monthly_rentals %>% kbl() %>% kable_styling()

jointed_df <- left_join(actual_monthly_rentals, expected_monthly_rentals, by = "month", copy = TRUE) %>% 
   mutate(excess_monthly_rentals = actual_per_month - expected_per_month,
         excess_rentals_pct_change = ((actual_per_month - expected_per_month) / expected_per_month),
         up = ifelse(actual_per_month>expected_per_month, excess_monthly_rentals, 0),
         down = ifelse(actual_per_month<expected_per_month, excess_monthly_rentals, 0),
         up_percent = ifelse(actual_per_month>expected_per_month, excess_rentals_pct_change, 0),
         down_percent = ifelse(actual_per_month<expected_per_month, excess_rentals_pct_change, 0)
         )
```

The first graph that we replicated shows the monthly changes in the number of TfL bike rentals for the period 2015-2020.
```{r,fig.width=22, fig.height= 8}
#plot the graph
plot_1 <- jointed_df %>% 
ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x=month, y = actual_per_month, group=year))+
  geom_line(aes(x=month, y = expected_per_month, group=year), color = "blue", size = 1)+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  theme_minimal()+
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=month, ymin=0,ymax=down),fill="#7DCD85",alpha=0.4) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=month, ymin=0,ymax=up),fill="#CB454A",alpha=0.4)+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(20000, 25000, 30000, 35000, 40000))+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(20000,40000))+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())+
  labs(
    title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",
    subtitle = "% change from monthly averages shown in blue and calculated between 2015-2019",
    y="",
    caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store"
  )+
  NULL
plot_1
```

We calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 to see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. 

```{r, fig.width=22, fig.height= 8}
# Build up the observed weekly bike rentals
actual_per_week <- bike %>% 
  group_by(year, week) %>% 
  filter(year>= 2015) %>% 
  summarise(actual_bikes_hired = median(bikes_hired)) 
actual_per_week %>% kbl() %>% kable_styling()

# Calculate the expected weekly rentals for each year
expected_per_week <- bike %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  filter(year>= 2015) %>%  
  summarise(expected_bikes_hired = median(bikes_hired)) 
expected_per_week %>% kbl() %>% kable_styling()

# Build-up the data frame to plot
jointed <- left_join(actual_per_week, expected_per_week, by = "week", copy = TRUE)%>% 
  mutate(excess_rentals = actual_bikes_hired - expected_bikes_hired,
         excess_rentals_pct_change = ((actual_bikes_hired - expected_bikes_hired) / expected_bikes_hired),
         up = ifelse(actual_bikes_hired>expected_bikes_hired, excess_rentals, 0),
         down = ifelse(actual_bikes_hired<expected_bikes_hired, excess_rentals, 0),
         up_percent = ifelse(actual_bikes_hired>expected_bikes_hired, excess_rentals_pct_change, 0),
         down_percent = ifelse(actual_bikes_hired<expected_bikes_hired, excess_rentals_pct_change, 0)
         )

```

And we plot the percentage changes:
```{r,fig.width=22, fig.height= 8}
# Plot the %changes
plot_2 <- jointed %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=week, y = excess_rentals_pct_change, group=year))+
 # geom_rect(data=q2_q4, inherit.aes=F,
           # aes(xmin=from, xmax=to, ymin=-Inf, ymax=+Inf), fill='lightgray', alpha=0.4) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~year, nrow = 2)+
  theme_minimal()+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=up_percent),fill="#7DCD85",alpha=0.4)  +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=down_percent),fill="#CB454A",alpha=0.4)+
  geom_rug(aes(colour=ifelse(actual_bikes_hired>=expected_bikes_hired,">=0","<0")),sides="b")+
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("#CB454A","#7DCD85"),name="Actual vs Expected ", guide=FALSE)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 53), breaks = c(13,26,39,53))+
  labs(
    title = "Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals",
    subtitle = "% change from weekly averages \ncalculated between 2015-2019",
    y="",
    caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store"
  )+
  NULL
plot_2

```

We can see from the graph that the actual rentals are quite different from the expectations and also show some seasonality.
